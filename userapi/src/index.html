          <td>/user/</td>
          <td>
            use this method on given path to add a new user to the REDIS DB. In

        <tr>
          <td>GET</td>
          <td>/user/:username</td>
          <td>
            use this method on given path to retrieve a specific user (giving
            his username in URL) from the REDIS DB.

      <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This application requires a REDIS DB to work
        perfectly. If you are using this application on AZURE or in a Docker
        container not linked with a REDIS container, API methods won't work for
        you.
